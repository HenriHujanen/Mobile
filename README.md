To run the project you need:
Android Studio (latest version recommended)
Android SDK with API 30 installed
Nexus 5X API 30 emulator set up in Android Studio

1. Clone the Repository:
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/HenriHujanen/Mobile.git

2. Open the Project in Android Studio:
Launch Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project." Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and select the project folder (the one containing build.gradle).

3. Install Dependencies:
Once the project is loaded in Android Studio, it may take a moment to sync and download the necessary dependencies. If prompted, allow Android Studio to update Gradle.

4. Configure Nexus 5X API 30 Emulator:
Open the "AVD Manager" in Android Studio by clicking on the icon in the toolbar or going to Tools > AVD Manager. If you haven't set up the Nexus 5X API 30 emulator yet, click on "Create Virtual Device," then select "Nexus 5X" as the device and choose API 30 as the system image. Follow the prompts to create the emulator.

5. Run the Project:
With the emulator set up, click on the green "Run" button (usually a play icon) in the toolbar or go to Run > Run 'app' to build and launch the app on the emulator.

6. Test the App:
The app should now be running on the Nexus 5X API 30 emulator.
